## Pages
Pages help you organise your different calculations. Each page is an isolated environment, with it's own inputs and options.

## Inputs

You can start by adding categories and values in the Inputs tab on the left. This app works like a concatenation of multiple financial calculators. Each value has the following options:

- **Title:** the displayed title on the graph.
- **Contribution / Month:** how much money is contributed to this value every month.
- **Start Date:** when the contributions start (inclusive)
- **End Date:** when the contributions stop (inclusive)
- **Contribution IPY (%):** how much the contributions will augment with time, in percentage per year.
- **APY (%):** how much the value of an investment will go up per year, in percentage per year.
- **Current Value:** the value at the moment, outside of contributions.

...and the following shortcuts:

- **One-Time:** sets the end date to the start date.
- **No End Date:** sets the end date in the year 2500.
- **CI = Inflation:** sets the CAPY to the inflation set in the options.

## Options
- **Constants**:
    - **Inflation:** sets the averare yearly inflation, in % per year.
- **Graph**:
    - **Month Interval:** sets on the graphs the month interval where values are shown (ex: 1 for monthly and 12 for yearly).
    - **First Month:** the first month shown on the graphs.
    - **Last Month:** the last month shown on the graphs.
- **Resulting Balance:** for a positive or a negative balance, setsin which investment to drop the remaining balance, in percentage.
